# unveil
a psychological horror game for hack club campfire flagship ! 
Its is supposed to showcase few differents psychological conditions such as disillusion, sub* abuse and trauma.
The game will be using Godot engine, light and can do some pretty good stuff in 3d from what I've heard.

*Note : this is my first game project, I had never done that before, please be understanding if it's not that good xD*

# How to play
https://ljbox.itch.io/unveil

Or build locally : 
``git clone https://github.com/LJBoxx/unveil.git``

Open with godot editor and build !

## Commands :

- zqsd/wasd : movement
- space : take pill
- left click : interract

## Known issues

I know it is very laggy on wasm, unfortunately there is a texture bug with the pill container... it doesn't do that inside godot debug editor, but only in wasm for some reason...

The game as of right now consist of finding all the pills container before your health runs out. Initially i wanted to make a sort of interractive story game but i need to ship something  ;-;
